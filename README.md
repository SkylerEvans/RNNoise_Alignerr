<br><br>

## Note
I did not create this plugin, they are adapted from werman's excellent plugins (https://github.com/werman/noise-suppression-for-voice), which is adapted from the original achine Learning noise reduction paper by Jean-Marc Valin (https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise). Element is created and maintained by Kushview, BlackHole is created and maintained by Existential Audio, and Equalizer APO is created and maintained by Jonas Thedering. These are open-source programs and freely available, though you may consider donating to their projects if they are useful to you.

I am providing them here as an easy repository for others to use in their own recording pipeline.
