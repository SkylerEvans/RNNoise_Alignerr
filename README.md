# RNNoise_Alignerr
A repository for RNNoise plug-ins to be available for Alignerr recordings.

Windows users should download the "rnnoise_mono.vst" file.

MacOS (Apple) users should download the "rnnoise.vst3" file, the Blackhole2ch.pkg file, and Kushview Element ([from here](https://github.com/kushview/element/releases/download/1.0.0b1/element-osx-1.0.0b1.dmg) ).


I did not create this plugin, they are adapted from werman's excellent plugins (https://github.com/werman/noise-suppression-for-voice), which is adapted from the original achine Learning noise reduction paper by Jean-Marc Valin (https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise).

I am providing them here as an easy repository for others to use in their own recording pipeline.
